(Thursday, June 4, 2020) - Revolutionary technology cools down any room at a fraction of the cost.</strong></p>
<p>Is your dorm room getting unbearably hot and humid with no AC? If so, you are not alone and there a millions of other Americans struggling to beat the heat this Summer. Fortunately, a breakthrough in modern science has just made our lives a whole lot cooler (pun intended).</p>
<p>"I couldn't believe that our dorm rooms didn't have air conditioning. I didn't know how I was going to pass the finals if I felt too hot, sticky and fatigued to study. I had to find a solution. One day it got so unbearable that I decided to put my engineering skills to the ultimate test and design my own portable AC. I had no idea that it would one day change the world."</p>
<p>"After 7 weeks our first unit was ready. We completely underestimated how well it would work. The news spread around the campus so quickly that hundreds of other students started begging me to make them one. I knew I was onto something big that could change the world."</p>
<p>Matthew's portable air conditioner became so popular that it gained attention of the media within the first month. <strong>Millions of people could now finally cool down any room thanks to what would soon become known as, 'Blaux Portable'.</strong></p>
<p>The AC unit is three times more efficient and cost effective than a regular AC unit, meaning you can cool down your room quicker at a fraction of the cost. It works so well that you can virtually cool down any room in minutes.</p>

      <h2>We had one of our colleagues try it out</h2>
      <p><strong>David Kilstein, a finance student, didn't even have AC in his home. - He was always complaining about how he wants to escape abroad during the Summer.</strong> Let's see how this test goes after testing Blaux's breakthrough technology.</p>
      <div class="yellow-box">
        <p><b>David's Results:</b> I opened the box and was very impressed with the build quality of the unit. I sat it in the corner of my study room, filled it with water and turned it on. After just 5 minutes my room was extremely chilly! I thought it was so cold that I had to turn it down a notch. This thing is a life saver!</p>

      <p>Since launching earlier this year, Blaux Portable has sold more than 150,000 portable AC units. And now that summer is here, we are expecting to sell out by end of August. So if you want to get your hands on one of these, for either yourself or a friend who has no AC, now's the time to do it.</p>
